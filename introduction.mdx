## Groundsetting

The promise of AI has opened the collective imagination of building applications that can help individual user's make better health decisions, improve their mental health, and overall better lives. Zooming out further, the promise for society is one of improving our understanding of curable diseases, improving technology, and unlocking a more fulfilled populace. Underlying both of these use cases, however, is the requirement of being able to succesfully model belief systems - both individual and collective.

The next question is how to advance these belief systems and what method of obtaining knowledge is the most useful. These questions of "how do we know how to know" have most frequently been contemplated within the philosophical field of epistemology.

## What is Epistemic Me

Epistemic Me is a philosophical toolkit for building AI models of self. It acts as a metamodern development framework - providing tools to both construct and destruct concepts of self and the world. To realize this, Epistemic Me uses Predictive Processing as a conceptual framework to build models of the world that can predict an agent's future behavior and choices.

### Core Capabilities

The capabilities of the SDK are aligned with our view of [philosophical history](/philosophy/overview), specifically to complement the philosophical strengths of generative AI. With Epistemic Me developers can:

- Model individual (self) and collective (interacting selves) belief systems and behaviors
- Build predictive self vs world models with error correction 
- Integrate intersubjective and interdisciplinary knowledge
- Embrace and quantify complexity and ambiguity
- Utilize disparate philosophical paradigms to test learning strategies
