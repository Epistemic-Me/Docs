## Post-Modernism: The Axiological Turn

### Key Questions

- **How do language and culture shape our understanding?**
- **Are universal truths possible, or is everything relative?**
- **How do power structures influence knowledge and ethics?**

### Philosophical Tools

- **Deconstruction**: Analyzing texts to reveal hidden assumptions and contradictions.
- **Critical Theory**: Examining society and culture to uncover power dynamics and ideologies.
- **Semiotics**: Studying signs and symbols as part of social communication.

### Conceptual Frameworks

- **Language Games**: Meaning arises from language use within specific contexts.
- **Power/Knowledge Nexus**: Power relations shape what is accepted as truth.
- **Metanarrative Skepticism**: Questioning overarching stories that claim to explain everything.

### Evolution of Thought

As the limitations of modernism became apparent, post-modernists emphasized the role of language, culture, and power in shaping our perceptions. **Friedrich Nietzsche** declared the "death of God," challenging traditional morality and emphasizing the will to power. **Sigmund Freud** delved into the unconscious mind, revealing hidden desires influencing behavior.

**Martin Heidegger** explored being and time, focusing on human existence and authenticity. **Ludwig Wittgenstein** shifted from logical structures to ordinary language, proposing that meaning is use. **Jacques Derrida** introduced deconstruction, revealing inherent contradictions in texts. **Michel Foucault** examined how societal institutions define knowledge and control.

**Hannah Arendt** analyzed totalitarianism and the nature of evil, emphasizing the importance of active citizenship. **Gilles Deleuze** and **Félix Guattari** challenged traditional structures, proposing concepts like the rhizome to represent non-hierarchical knowledge.

Understanding biases and cultural influences is crucial today, especially in AI ethics, where algorithms can inadvertently perpetuate existing inequalities.
