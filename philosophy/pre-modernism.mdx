## Pre-Modernism: Foundations in Metaphysics

### Key Questions

- **What is the fundamental nature of reality?**
- **How do unseen forces shape the visible world?**
- **What does it mean to live in harmony with the cosmos?**

### Philosophical Tools

- **Metaphysical Speculation**: Exploring beyond the physical to understand existence.
- **Dialectical Reasoning**: Engaging in dialogue to uncover deeper truths.
- **Myth and Allegory**: Using stories to convey complex ideas.

### Conceptual Frameworks

- **Theory of Forms**: The belief in eternal, unchanging ideals that transcend the physical world.
- **Substance and Essence**: Investigating what things are made of and their inherent nature.
- **Virtue Ethics**: Focusing on character and virtues as the basis for ethical living.

### Evolution of Thought

In the ancient world, philosophers sought to understand the universe by looking beyond the physical. **Thales** proposed that water is the fundamental substance of everything, while **Heraclitus** argued that change itself is the essence of reality. **Pythagoras** introduced numerical relationships as fundamental principles, bridging mathematics and philosophy. **Plato** presented the Theory of Forms, suggesting that the material world is a shadow of a higher, immutable reality. His student, **Aristotle**, shifted focus to the observable world, emphasizing empirical observation and categorization.

In the East, thinkers like **Confucius** and **Laozi** explored ethics, governance, and the nature of the Tao (the Way), emphasizing harmony with natural order and societal roles. **Buddha** examined suffering and the path to enlightenment, offering insights into the human condition.

These early thinkers laid the groundwork for considering abstract concepts as foundational elementsâ€”a perspective that resonates with today's focus on algorithms and data structures in technology.

### Key Philosophers

- **Socrates**: Advocated for the examined life, using questioning to seek truth and ethics.
- **Plato**: Developed the Theory of Forms, asserting that non-material abstract forms represent the most accurate reality.
- **Aristotle**: Advocated for empirical observation, laying the foundations for scientific inquiry.
