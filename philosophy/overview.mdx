# History of Philosophy: Metaphysics to Self-Models

This document explores the journey of philosophical thought from ancient inquiries about reality to modern innovations in AI. Our aim is to demonstrate how philosophy is not just an academic discipline but a living, evolving practice that can augment our use of AI and help solve new and complex problems.

## Introduction

Philosophy has grappled with the big questions: What is reality? How do we know what we know? What does it mean to live a good life? Each era approached these questions differently, influenced by its cultural context and technological capabilities. Today, as we face unprecedented technological advancements, we can integrate these inquiries with cutting-edge tools.

**Epistemic Me** is an SDK designed to model "Selves" as Self-Models, offering developers a philosophical toolkit to build systems that process information and adapt and learn like humans. By integrating insights from philosophy, neuroscience, and AI, we can create technology that aligns with human experience.

## Epistemic Me: Philosophy Meets Technology

At the intersection of philosophy and technology, **Epistemic Me** embodies the meta-modern ethos by embracing complexity and fostering integration. Our SDK models "Selves" as Self-Models, allowing developers to create systems that perceive, predict, and adapt in ways akin to human cognition.

Each Self-Model has a philosophy with explicit Metaphysics, Epistemology, Axiology, and Ontology. By incorporating predictive processing, our tools enable conceptualization of an agent's internal models of the world. In turn, the model can be used to model the agent's capacity to predict of outcomes, and adjust their actions accordingly. This aligns with the philosophical progression toward understanding the self and reality as dynamic, interconnected processes.

## Conclusion

The journey from ancient philosophers' metaphysical speculations to meta-modernism reveals a clear trend: an ever-deepening understanding of reality that embraces complexity and seeks to integrate knowledge across disciplines and subjective experiences. **Epistemic Me** stands on this continuum, offering tools that are both philosophically grounded and technologically advanced.

By simplifying the history of philosophy into a coherent narrative, we aim to inspire you to see the relevance of these ideas today. Whether you're a developer, a thinker, or curious about the interplay between philosophy and technology, explore how philosophical tools can inform and enhance modern innovation.

Join us in bridging timeless philosophical questions and cutting-edge possibilities of AI. Together, we can build a future where technology understands us.
