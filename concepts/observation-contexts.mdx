## Observation Contexts

An Observation Context is a set of beliefs that are grouped together based on how the Self-Model perceives the world. For example, if a Self-Model is tracking their sleep and heart rate variability, they might create an Observation Context for "Sleep and Heart Rate Variability".

### Creating an Observation Context

```python
observation_context = epistemic_me.ObservationContext.create(
    self_model_id="self_001",
    name="Sleep and Heart Rate Variability",
    possible_values=[
        {"sleep_min": 0},
        {"sleep_max": 16},
        {"hrv_min": 0},
        {"hrv_max": 150}
    ],
    context="sleep_and_hrv"
)
```

### Working with Observation Contexts

Observation Contexts can be used to:
- Group related beliefs together
- Provide context for falsifiable and causal beliefs
- Define possible values for observations
- Track historical observations and evidence

### Conceptualized Belief Systems

When working with Observation Contexts, you can create a Conceptualized Belief System that forms a graph data structure representing an ontology of a Self-Model:

```python
belief_system = epistemic_me.SelfModel.retrieve_belief_system(
   id="self_001",
   conceptualize=True
)
```
