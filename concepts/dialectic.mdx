## Dialectic

A Dialectic updates a Self-Model's Belief System based on the discrepancy between the prediction and the observed state of the world. Only one Dialectic can be active at a time for a given Self-Model.

### Dialectic Interactions

During a Dialectic session, the Dialectic can have three types of Interactions:

1. **Question -> Answer.** A question posed to the user, and the answer provided updates the user's Self-Model's Belief System.
2. **Hypothesis -> Evidence.** An event that is observed to evidence a belief.
3. **Action -> Outcomes.** An event that is observed to characterize the results of an action.

### Creating a Dialectic Session

```python
import epistemic_me
epistemic_me.api_key = "..."

self_model = epistemic_me.SelfModel.create(id="self_001")
dialectic = epistemic_me.Dialectic.create(self_model_id=self_model.id)
```
