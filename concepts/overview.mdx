## The Core Concepts

### Self-Model

The Epistemic Me SDK is built to enable developers to create models of real-world agents. The Self-Model is a representation of the agent that is being modeled. An agent might be a person, an animal, a cell, a culture, a country, etc. A Self-Model mirrors the agency of any real-world agent that is able to act upon the world, based on an internal model of the world.

The Self-Model can make predictions about the state of the world based on its internal model of the world - a belief system. It can compare these predictions against the actual state of the world to update its belief system.

Self-Models can have Philosophies attached to them that are used to provide context, or lens, to the AI generated Belief Systems particular to the self.
